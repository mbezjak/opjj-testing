Introduction to [mocks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object). Example shows
employer ACME offering jobs to everyone that is willing to work for `X` amount
of money.

Required [EasyMock](http://www.easymock.org) library is provided in `lib`
directory for simplicity. Other projects should use a build tool, such as
[gradle](http://www.gradle.org).
